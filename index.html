                <p align="justify">
                    How can we read without eyes? What kind of a world would it be? 
                    The aim of this work is to build a spiritual space in a 'tactile, auditory' environment, to explore a 'sightless' spiritual space. 
                    I seek to amplify the senses of hearing and touch and diminish the sense of sight. 
                    In this work, touch is the trigger for vibrations and sounds to obtain information.

                <h3>Concept and Background Research</h3>
                
                <p align="justify">
                    Not seeing is a limitation and seeing is a limitation as well. 
                    I believe that the word of the visually impaired is rich and varied since they live in a virtual world designed on the basis of a "real world" of imagination. 
                    For me, the world of sound is my desired world, and the imagination of my spiritual world.
                </p>


                <p align="justify"> 
                    Firstly, the definition of space is the same as boundaries, the range of thresholds, I believed. 
                    This is very subjective since the boundaries of space are constantly changing, depending on the references. 
                    In 'Another way' there is a constantly shifting spatial structure and hierarchy from physical and mental space. 
                    Those spaces are nested by different materials and sounds.
                </p>

                <p align="justify"> 
                    Besides, the environment is one of the key elements of the space of place, determining the structure and content of space. 
                    As Christian Norberg-Schulz, the "GENIUS LOCI" is an objectification and spatialization of one's memory, a sense of identity and belonging to a place". 
                    Moon karma is also based on this sense of belonging, combining sound healing with singing bowls to relax the body and mind. 
                    The sound from blows is divided into seven tones by the size of the blows, the thickness of the material, and the handmade points inside of the blows so that the body's nervous system, the cells, perceive the vibrations and respond with the sound world of the bowls.
                </p>

                <p align="justify"> 
                    Sound is the special environment in my space. 
                    It is produced by vibration, and travels in waves. The speed of sound is related to the density and elasticity of the material, which have impact on the sound of tone. 
                    Aluminium is the fastest transmitting metal with a speed of 6,320 m/second, while the speed of sound in copper is 4,600 m/second. 
                    Those psychic metal spaces in a "no vision" environment are trying to explore the relationship between perception and transmission.
                </p>

                <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
              
                <p align="justify">
                    At the very beginning, I was also inspired by the works of Nicolas Bras, who focuses on physical sound. 
                    He is good at discovering the sounds between different materials and making various 'instrumental' sculptures. 
                    So that I found the possibility of sound. Like the quick demo sketch.
                </p>

                <p align="justify">
                    And then, I found Alessandro Perini's work <em>Epicentro</em>, which completely changed the form of piano performance. 
                    What he did is not only to present the music but made music perform on its own. 
                    Inspired by his work, I am thinking that sound language. 
                    The possibility of sound to express or know things rather than visuals.
                </p>


                <p align="justify"> 
                    In this project, the CapacitiveSensor as input, using the human body as a sensor to connect the whole circuit. 
                    The copper tape acts as a button in my circuit like on-and-off.
                    The servo motor controls the cardboard floating up and down to make the metal box move from side to side, as well as the vibration motors to increase the vibration effect.
